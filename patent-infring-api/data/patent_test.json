    "abstract": "Systems and methods are provided for generating and/or modifying a shopping list from a mobile advertisement. The advertisement can be targeted from a predefined algorithm, from multiple algorithms, or generated in real time based on items presented to a user. The advertisement may be random. When the advertisement is selected for viewing, it provides the option for saving information about the advertised product to a shopping list. The list may be a remote list that may be accessed via a deep link URL, a cloud-based storage solution, and/or it may be local to the mobile device.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY\n\n\nThe technology of this application relates generally to digital advertisements and more specifically but not exclusively to creating and/or modifying an electronic list by adding an item associated with a digital advertisement to the list.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE TECHNOLOGY\n\n\nDigital advertisements are often displayed within mobile applications or on mobile websites and often link to other mobile websites or HTML pages, such that when a consumer clicks on or otherwise selects the advertisement, that consumer is taken to a website other than the one they are browsing. This can be annoying to consumers, especially if they did not select the advertisement on purpose.\n\nDigital Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) companies, among others, sell products through brick and mortar stores. As such, there exists a need to find innovative ways to provide effective digital ads that are accepted by consumers and that lead to in-store/brick and mortar purchases.\n\nAdditionally, with the rise of new services such as curb-side pickup and grocery delivery services, consumer shopping habits have changed. Impulse purchases, which currently occur while a consumer walks through a store, do not occur when a consumer plans/executes their shopping trip from home, work or some other location other than in the store and never physically enters the store.\n\nIt may be advantageous to create systems and methods for generating advertisements with Add-To-List capabilities to facilitate adding products to a shopping list for a consumer who views or otherwise selects an advertisement.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE TECHNOLOGY\n\n\nMany advantages will be determined and are attained by one or more embodiments of the technology, which in a broad sense provides systems and methods for generating and/or modifying a shopping list for a consumer who views or otherwise selects a digital advertisement. An item may be added to the shopping list upon the consumer selecting the advertisement, or the consumer may be provided the option to (i) add the item while viewing the advertisement, (ii) not add the item, (iii) open the list to view which items have already been added, or (iv) add the item to the list at a later time (in which case one or more reminders may be manually or automatically be configured or a trigger event may be set which causes the item to be added to the list).\n\nIn one or more implementations of the technology, a computer-implemented method is provided for generating a digital shopping list. At least a portion of the method may be performed by a computing device that includes at least one processor. The method may include presenting an electronic advertisement associated with a product, for display on a mobile device. The method also may include the mobile device receiving input indicating a selection of the advertisement, and the mobile device routing a mobile application (âappâ) on the mobile device to an online shopping list. The method may also include the mobile device adding an identification of the associated product to the shopping list.\n\nIn one or more implementations of the technology, a system for generating a digital shopping list from an advertisement displayed on a mobile device is provided. The system may include a mobile advertisement presentation module, stored in memory, that provides a mobile advertisement, that advertises a product, for display on a mobile device. The system may also include an advertisement selection module, stored in memory, that detects when an advertisement has been selected for viewing, and a routing module, stored in memory, that routes a browser located on the mobile device to a shopping list. The system may include a list generating module, stored in memory, that enters information about the advertised product into the shopping list, and at least one processor that executes the mobile advertisement presentation module, the advertisement selection module, the routing module, and the list generating module.\n\nIn one or more implementations of the technology, a non-transitory computer-readable medium including one or more computer-executable instructions is provided which, when executed by at least one processor of a computing device, cause the computing device to present an advertisement for a product on a display of a mobile device. The computer-executable instructions may also cause the computing device to detect a selection of the advertisement for viewing, open a remote shopping list, and enter information about the advertised product into the shopping list.\n\nThe technology will next be described in connection with certain illustrated embodiments and practices. However, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that various modifications, additions and subtractions can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the claims.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\nField of Invention\n\n\nThe instant invention relates to certain new and useful improvements in a combined spreader and rake hand tool. The invention also relates to improvements in a combined spreader and rake hand tool, which is particularly useful in moving gravel and leveling gravel and stone having sizes up to about 2 inches and is particularly adapted for spreading and smoothing aggregate for concrete, cement, or other materials which containing binder and an aggregate.\n\n\nPrior Art\n\n\nThere exist many prior devices for moving ground material, such as rock, dirt, gravel, debris, leaves, etc. In the case of hand tools, these commonly include, rakes, spreaders and hoes. With respect to stone and aggregate, many factors dictate aggregate size, including particular application, method of placement, regional availability of materials, admixtures etc. and accordingly the type of hand tool which is used to move the same.\n\nIn the case of making a desired concrete surface and in order to minimize cracking, it is ideal to use a mix design containing aggregates ranging from natural sand, to 1Â¼â³ at an average of 18-22% of each size by weight. Hand tools available on the market today fail to provide an adequate tool for moving such aggregate by hand. Accordingly, there remains a need for an improved hand tool to aid in moving aggregate as well as other surface material.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n\nIt is an object to provide a tool of the above mentioned character that is simple and sturdy in construction and that is so constructed and arranged that it can be used as a tool for spreading material, such as stone and aggregate for concrete while the operator remains in a standing position, and the handle of the tool is inclined at a convenient angle for operating the same from the body portion or blade of the tool toward an operator.\n\nA further object is to provide a dual function spreader and rake for multiple tasks, including raking stones, vines, debris, leaves, etc., and spreading and smoothing ground surface which may include dirt, rock, and/or aggregate.\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a spreader and rake having pitched teeth on a first elongated side of a back support plate connected to a handle, and having pitched edge on an opposing second elongated side of the back support plate.\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a readily cleanable spreader and rake.\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a unitary head forming part of a spreader and rake.\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a spreader and rake having a sufficient weight and strength structure to pulverize ground and rake loose material.\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a spreader and rake hand tool having pitched teeth on a first elongated side of a back support plate which provides sufficient rigidity and strength to cut and remove grass, vines or ground surface and will sink into loose dirt and will pulverize the dirt while the debris is being raked up.\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a hand spreader and rake may be turned over and using a pitched level edge to serve in pulling, pushing or spreading debris, aggregate or material along the ground.\n\nAccordingly, the invention is directed to a spreader and rake tool including a head having a body portion or blade, preferably made of steel or other rigid material, that can be of uniform thickness from a toothed working edge thereof to the level working edge thereof, with a handle secured to a back support plate portion which connects normal relative to the back plate portion, a first plate portion extending from a first side of said back plate portion having the toothed edge and a second plate portion extending from a second side of said back plate portion having the level edge, wherein each of the plate portions extend at an angle of from between 5 to 45 degrees relative to the back support plate portion. To accomplish the purposes of the invention it is necessary that the axis of the handle extend at an angle of approximately 90 degrees to the back support plate portion, enabling the tool to be used both as a raking and spreading or leveling tool, in either case with the working edge thereof directed toward the operator and the handle inclined at an angle toward the operator so that the operator can stand in such a position as to rake or smooth surface material.\n\nBy the use of my invention, the operation of moving heavy and relatively large aggregate can be carried out successively from a standing position, because of the character of the tool comprising the rigid and durable blade with its angled plate portions present a unique tool which renders it easier to move aggregate and/or scraping, rake or smoothing operation to be performed while the operator is in a standing position greatly speeding up the operation over that possible with the tools previously used for this purpose. This is due to the fact that the unique blade configuration and with portions angled as previously stated, that the the blade or body portion can be engaged with the aggregate, debris or surface with the handle extending an angled relative to the surface in a most effective way in order to reduce fatigue of the user.\n\nOther objects and advantages of my invention will appear as the description of the drawings proceeds. I desire to have it understood, however, that I do not intend to limit myself to the particular details shown and described, except as defined in the claims. With the above and related objects in view, this invention consists in the details of construction and combination of parts, as will be more fully understood from the following description, when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing.\n",
